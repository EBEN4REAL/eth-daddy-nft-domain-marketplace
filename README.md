# ETH Daddy 

ETH Daddy is a lightweight, ENS-style domain marketplace dApp. It showcases a full stack Web3 flowâ€”Solidity smart contracts (listing and purchasing domains), Hardhat for local development/testing, and a React frontend powered by Ethers for on-chain reads/writes. The deploy script seeds example domains (e.g., jack.eth, john.eth) with prices, and the UI lets users connect a wallet, browse available domains, and buy them with ETH. Ownership and listings are recorded on-chain, making this a solid reference for learning contract interactions, provider/network handling, and building a simple marketplace experience.

Features
On-chain registry and marketplace for human-readable .eth-style domains

Pre-seeded sample listings via deploy script for quick demos

Wallet connect, network detection, and live contract reads (e.g., supply, domain data)

Example tests and local workflow with Hardhat

Note: This project is a learning/demo implementation and not affiliated with ENS.
